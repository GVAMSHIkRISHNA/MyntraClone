This is a clone of the Myntra website using HTML and CSS. The project contains the following structure:

index.html: This file contains the structure and content of the website.
styles.css: This file contains the CSS styling for the website.
The project uses HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling. No JavaScript was used in this project.

Here's an example of the HTML structure:
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Logo, navigation, and other header elements go here -->
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- Home page, product listing, and other page elements go here -->
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Footer elements such as contact information, links, and legal information go here -->
    </footer>
</body>
The website clone features the same header, footer, and general layout as the original Myntra website. It also includes sections for the home page, product listings, and other pages that make up the website.
